<h3>Fast scrambled egg recipe</h3>
This is a quick recipe on making scrambled eggs to perfection
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>4 large eggs</em></li>
<li><em>9 tbsp of whole milk</em></li>
<li><em>A knob of butter</em></li>
    <li><em>salt and pepper to taste</em></li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Directions</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>Lightly whisk 4 large eggs, 9 tbsp single cream or full cream milk and a pinch of salt together until the mixture has just one consistency.</li>
<li>Heat a small non-stick frying pan for a minute or so, then add a knob of butter and let it melt. Donâ€™t allow the butter to brown or it will discolour the eggs.</li>

<li>Give a final stir and serve the velvety scramble without delay.</li>
<li>a pinch of black pepper to taste when you are done plating for extra flavor.</li>
</ol>
